The sitemap created via Draw io outlines the interaction between each web page.

There are four main pages - Home, About, Projects and Contact. As these are the main touchpoints featuring my skills, capabilities and contact method, they are accessible at all times through the navigation bar.

The Projects page is a gateway to my previous works. Clicking on the thumbnail will direct the user to its respective blog post that explains the project in more depth.

The Contacts page involves a contact form that can be filled out. Once submitted, the user is taken to a confirmation page to reassure the user that the form has been submitted.

The footer on each page includes links to my social media pages on a new tab. My email address can be clicked to send me an email directly.

## Wireframes

### Phone View (< 768px)
![wireframe for phone view](docs/wireframe-phone.png)


### Tablet View (768px - 1199px)
![wireframe for tablet view](docs/wireframe-tablet.png)

### Desktop View (> 1200px)

#### Version 1
![draft wireframe for desktop view](docs/wireframe-desktop-1.png)
The first version for desktop view was created to keep a very similar layout as the tablet view. However, it was determined to have too much dead space on the side. Layout was to be reconsidered for a more balanced view.

#### Version 2
![final wireframe for desktop view](docs/wireframe-desktop-2.png)
The second version for desktop view involved relocating the header to the left side of the page. The navigation bar remains to be accessible and offer greater balance between the different sections of the website.

## Components

### Header
The header consists of the logo, name and navigation bar. It is locked in place with sticky position to allow easy access wherever the user is on the page.

The tablet and desktop view displays the logo and name, whereas the phone view only displays the logo for simplicity and space. Clicking the logo or name directs the user to the home page.

The navigation bar includes links to the different pages on the website - Home, About, Projects and Contact.

### Footer
The footer consists of the copyright notice, email address and social media links.

My email address is included as an alternative contact method to the contact form. It is a link so that the user can click to email me directly, rather than copying and pasting my email address.

Links to my social media is displayed as icons, and clicking on each icon will open a new tab to its respective social media page.

### Main
The content within the main component varies for each page. Majority of the text alignment and positioning are conformed to deliver consistency.

## Pages

### About Me

### Projects
