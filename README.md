### Desktop View

#### Version 1
![draft wireframe for desktop view](docs/wireframe-desktop-1.png)
The first version for desktop view was created to have a very similar layout as tablet view. However, it was determined to have too much dead space on the side. Layout was to be reconsidered for a more balanced view.

#### Version 2
![final wireframe for desktop view](docs/wireframe-desktop-2.png)
The second version for desktop view involved relocating the header to the left side of the page. The navigation bar remains to be accessible and offer more balance between the different sections of the website.

## Components

### Header
The header consists of the logo, name and navigation bar. It is a sticky element to allow easy access wherever the user is on the page.

The tablet and desktop view displays the logo and name, whereas the phone view only displays the logo for simplicity. Clicking the logo or name directs the user to the home page.

The navigation bar includes links to the different pages on the website - Home, About, Projects and Contact.

### Footer
The footer consists of my email address and social media links.

Links to my social media is displayed as icons, and clicking on each icon will open a new tab to its respective social media page.
